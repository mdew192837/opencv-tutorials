    "\n",
    "So we know that color images consist of `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's Discuss in Context of Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "So the channels of the wave would be as follows:\n",
    "- the red channel would be very heavy since it's not represented\n",
    "- the blue channel would be very light since it's represented a lot\n",
    "- the green channel would be in the middle since it's slightly represented\n",
    "\n",
    "## So.... How Do We Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that OpenCV stores RGB values for images using `[B, G, R]` instead of `[R, G, B]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the image into the channels using `cv2.split(image)`\n",
    "2. Display each channel individually using `cv2.imshow(\"Red\", R)` for example\n",
    "3. Merge the channels by using `cv2.merge([B, G, R])`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to actually show the color in each channel, just pass in zeros for the other arguments in R, G, B format.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if you wanted to show red, you would have `[zeros, zeros, R]` noting that images in OpenCV again are stored in `[B, G, R]` instead of `[R, G, B]`\n",

    "## Changing Color Spaces\n",
