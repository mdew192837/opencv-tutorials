    "1. First you use `numpy` to create an array of 0s the same size as the image (`image.shape[:2]` for 2-D), which effectively provides you a black canvas.\n",
    "2. Then you use `cv2.rectangle` to draw a rectangle on that `mask` with specified top left corner and bottom right corner. Note that you pass in `255` as the color to make it white, and `-1` to make it filled in\n",
